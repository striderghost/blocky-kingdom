#Blocky Kingdom Tutorial

##**Setup**
The setup is pretty easy. You simply place the three .jar - files from the GitHub release in your plugins - Folder and you
should be good to go. To ensure that the structures and kingdoms are generated correctly you should also delete the current
world folders and let the server generate a new world.
Furthermore, you need to install a the Blocky Kingdom resource pack so you can see the custom items and mobs (https://github.com/JonathanDotExe/blocky-kingdom-resourcepack).

##**Player-Menu**
The player menu is the central menu for most contents of the plugin. You can open it by shift-clicking the off-hand slot in your
inventory. From there you can upgrade your stats, see stuff like skill points, level, xp and money and access like submenus for
skills, claiming/moderating kingdoms. When play a little around in this menu it is probably pretty self-explainatory.

##**Stat-Values**
Each player has stat values for attack damage, damage resistance, health, sprint speed and magic (has effect on custom magic weapons).
These values can be upgraded using skill points which you gain through level-ups and gaining xp.

##**Species and Professions**
When a player first joins they get a menu that asks them what species/profession they want to be. Each species shifts the value
range of some stats for the player (e.g. from 0 - 10 to 2 - 12 or -1 - 9). Each profession initially upgrades some stats.
Both each species and each profession have their own special skill which only they can learn.

##**Skills**
Skills are additional abilities a player can perform. They can be bought using skill points in the skill sub-menu of the player menu.
The most important skill is probably "climbing" which allows the player to climb walls by sneaking, looking up and moving forward
in front of a wall (might need some practise ;))

##**Kingdoms**
The world is separated into kingdoms. Kingdoms can be uncivilized, good or evil. The uncivilized ones don't have any inhabitants
and are cheap to claim, the good ones have a castle and villages in them but are expensive and evil ones are unclaimable and
the villagers will attack you (ways to claim them are planned). Players who own a kingdom can summon villagers that trade and defend
the kingdom. They can be summoned using a recruiter villager or by building special houses (probably will make a video about it on YouTube).

##**Boss Progression**
The game has a row of bosses that build up on another. The first one is a zombie boss which can be found on towers. It drops an
executioners scythe. Using this zombies will sometimes drop their skulls when you kill them. By placing a zombie skull on a
slime blcok the Slimerer will spawn. The slimerer will then drop the Slimerers Heart which can be used for craftig and rainbow dye
which will spawn a Rainbow Sheep when using it. This sheep is rideable and can fly. If you fly to the build limit on it and leave it, 
you will be teleported to the sky. When you build a special structure out of wool there and place a skeleton skull on it, the Airhead
boss will spawn (YouTube video coming soon hopefully). This is the last boss by now.
